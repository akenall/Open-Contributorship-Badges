Open-Contributorship-Badges
===========================

## Intro

Research is increasingly reliant on a wide variety of skills ranging from data analysis, programming, and other contributor roles. Unfortunately, the current reward system in academia often fails to give credit for contributions beyond authorship on an article. Can we use the Open Badge Infrastructure at Mozilla to overcome this? This repository is to help get this off the ground at MozFest.

We'll split up into two groups--one for creating and using badges and one for building the badge tool and integration. See files on Badge Creation and [Build and Infrastructure] (myLib/Build and Infrastructure.md).

## Session Aims

**From the badge creation side** to start putting together badges that can be used to help engage the research community in using the badges and to help solidify criteria for the 14 badges we have. 

**From the Build and Infrastructure** side, get to know the infrastructure out there, find out what's achievable with what's out there, hash out some long-term details (eg, where will the data live, how are we going to organise the work, etc). Finally, can we with the tools out there now, build a quick rough and ready demo in the next few days/weeks? 

## Agenda

1.	Short Presentation. What are Open Badges? Problem of contributorship and credit in science. How can Open Badges help this.
2.	Run through. How will this sprint work? 
3.	Whoâ€™s who. How many researchers? Any designers? Publishers?
4.	Form teams. 
5.	Badge creation/brainstorming group. 
6.	Build and Infrastructure.
7.	Halfway presentation from both groups and feedback
8.	Back to groups
10.	Summing it up
