Open-Contributorship-Badges
===========================

esearch is increasingly reliant on a wide variety of skills ranging from data analysis, programming, and other contributor roles. Unfortunately, the current reward system in academia often fails to give credit for contributions beyond authorship on an article. Can we use the Open Badge Infrastructure at Mozilla to overcome this? This repository is to help get this off the ground at MozFest.
