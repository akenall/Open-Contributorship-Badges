# Badges Creation

Researcher? Designer? Librarian? This group could be for you. You'll be reviewing the current researcher contributorship taxonomy and brainstorming new badges. You'll also be reviewing the criteria needed to earn a badge and putting forward ideas on who should be issuing badges. Finally, you can start shaping some Research Badge Pathways. These will be used in advocacy later on. See below for a suggested breakdown of this group's time.

## Badges Review (85 min)

You'll have lots of A3 paper, sharpies, and post-its to start your review of the current badges and brainstorming any skills missing. Try starting with these questions:

**1. What research skills are valuable? (20 min)** 

For example, besides publications, what skills do you want to see when you hire someone? Eg, try writing down your different roles as a researcher. What are some of the most valuable things you learned to do in those roles? Or consider new training: Software Carpentry, Open Science Reproducibility training. Does any of this training necessitate a digital credential? Would Principal Investigtors/hirers be interested in seeing it?

On a piece of A3 paper, brainstorm a list of useful skills (from both the employer and employee point of view).

**2. How do these skills compare with the prototype badges? Are any new badges needed? (15 min)**

For every new badge you come up with, give it its own A3 page (as has been done with the 14 prototype badges). Sketch out what skills this badge reflects? For example, a short description like "development and design of methodology; creation of models" for the Methodology badge. 


## Criteria and issuer (50 min)

The criteria needed to earn each badge (for the 14 prototypes and any new ones) is still undecided. Under each badge A3 sheet, set out the criteria the issuer will be able to evaluate in order to issue the badge. Also suggest who might possibly issue each badge. 

## Presentation Prep (15 min)
Take 15 min to put together a quick presentation (roughly 5min for presenting, 5 for questions)

## Badges Pathways (till end)

What could badge pathways look like? Map out as many badge pathways as possible from role to role on large A3 sheets.
