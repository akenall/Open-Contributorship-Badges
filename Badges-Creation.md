# Badges Creation

Researcher? Designer? Librarian? This group could be for you. You'll be reviewing the current researcher contributorship taxonomy and brainstorming new badges. You'll also be reviewing the criteria needed to earn a badge and putting forward ideas on who should be issuing badges. Finally, you can start shaping some Research Badge Pathways. These will be used in advocacy later on. See below for a suggested breakdown of this group's time.

## Badges Review (85 min)

You'll have lots of A3 paper, sharpies, and post-its to start your review of the current badges and brainstorming any skills missing. Try starting with these questions:

**1. What research skills are valuable? (20 min)** 
For example, besides publications, what skills do you want to see when you hire someone? Eg, try writing down your different roles as a researcher. What are some of the most valuable things you learned to do in those roles? Or consider new training: Software Carpentry, Open Science Reproducibility training. Does any of this training necessitate a digital credential? Would Principal Investigtors/hirers be interested in seeing it?

**2. How do these skills compare with the prototype badges? Are any new badges needed? (15 min)**

**3.	What are the criteria for each badge? (30 min)**

**4.	Who will be issuing it? Who would you like to see issuing badges? (20 min)**

## Presentation Prep (15 min)
Take 15 min to put together a quick presentation (roughly 5min for presenting, 5 for questions)

## Badges Pathways (till end)

What could badge pathways look like? Map out as many badge pathways as possible from role to role on large A3 sheets.
