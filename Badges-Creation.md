# Badges Creation

This group could include researchers, designers, librarians, and others involved in the badging experience.
You'll be brainstorming what credit is missing in research. 


## Badges Review (85min)

You'll have lots of A3 paper, sharpies, and post-its to start your review of the current badges and brainstorming any skills missing. Try starting with these questions:

**1. What research skills are valuable? (20 min)** 
For example, besides publications, what skills do you want to see when you hire someone? Eg, try writing down your different roles as a researcher. What are some of the most valuable things you learned to do in those roles?

**2. How do these skills compare with the prototype badges? Are any new badges needed? (15 min)**

**3.	What are the criteria for each badge? (30 min)**

**4.	Who will be issuing it? (20 min)**

## Presentation Prep (15 min)
Take 15 min to put together a quick presentation (roughly 5min for presenting, 5 for questions)

## Badges Pathways (till end)

What could badge pathways look like? Map out as many badge pathways as possible from role to role on large A3 sheets.
