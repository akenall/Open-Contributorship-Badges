# Getting Started

I'll (Amye) start the session off by quickly seeing what kind of group we have, guaging the level of knowledge people have about open badges, and giving a quick 5 min presentation about badges and answer any questions.
Then I'll run through how this will work. One team will work on "badges brainstorming" and further refining the badges prototypes. The other team will work on assessing the badges infrastructure already out there and thinking through what/who an issuer and what a workflow for earning a badge might look like. 

**Breaking off into teams.** Let's break off into two groups. Depending on how many people there are, we might then break down the groups even further. Each of the two groups should have a leader/time keeper to keep track of time and possibly to break up tasks depending on the size of group.

**Leader/timekeeper**. Group leader: it's your job to keep the time across the whole group. Take a look at the agenda for your group and make sure the group sticks to time. Don't worry if you're a bit faster or slower in some bits. As long as it all comes out in the wash, you're okay. Also take a look at the size of your group. How many people do you have? Five or less? Then you're good to go as is. More than that? It might help to split the group down into groups of five. Can you split up any of the agenda? For example, with the Build and Infrastructure group, give each group a few bits of the architecture to investigate and then report back on.
