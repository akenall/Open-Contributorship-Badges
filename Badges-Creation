# Badges Creation

This group could include researchers, designers, librarians, and others involved in the badging experience.
You'll be brainstorming what credit is missing in research. 

## Hour 1

You'll have lots of A3 paper, sharpies, and post-its to start your brainstorming. Try starting with these questions:

**1. What research skills are valuable?** 
For example, besides publications, what skills do you want to see when you hire someone? Eg, try writing down your different roles as a researcher. What are some of the most valuable things you learned to do in those roles?

**2.	Do any of these need a digital credential?**

**3.	What are the criteria for each badge?**

**4.	Who will be issuing it?**
