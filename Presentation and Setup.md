# Presentation

I'll (Amye) start the session off by quickly seeing what kind of group we have, guaging the level of knowledge people have about open badges, and giving a quick 5 min presentation about badges and answer any questions.
Then I'll run through how this. One team will work on "badges brainstorming" and further refining the badges prototypes, and the other team will work on assessing the badges infrastructure already out there and thinking through what/who an issuer and what a workflow for earning a badge might look like. 

Breaking off into teams. Let's break off into two groups. Depending on how many people there are, we might then break down the groups even further. Each of the two groups should have a leader/time keeper to keep track of time and possibly to break up tasks depending on the size of group.

# Setup

Set up A3 pages for each badge.
For each group, make sure the group agenda is posted clearly on A3 size paper.
